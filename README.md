# MMAI831 Watts Team

This is a repository for team collaboration on MMAI831 assignments.
Each assignment gets its own directory.

## Avoiding overwriting each other's work

Team members are encouraged to work in their own branches and avoid pushing
directly into branch *main*. Pulls to *main* will be done during meetings.

```
git checkout -n <your branch name>
<Do work>
git add .
git commit -m'A message on what you did'
git push -u origin <your branch name>
```
